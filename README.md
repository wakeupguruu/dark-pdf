# Dark-pdf

## Project Description

**Dark-pdf** is a web application that converts standard PDF files into a dark mode version. It ensures a pure black background, high-contrast white text, and keeps images and photos as natural as possible for comfortable night-time reading. The app runs entirely in your browserâ€”no files are uploaded to any server.

## Features
- Converts PDF backgrounds to pure black
- Makes text high-contrast (white)
- Keeps images/photos natural (no harsh inversion)
- Simple drag-and-drop or click-to-upload interface
- Download the converted PDF with a suggested filename

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Drag and drop a PDF file onto the upload area, or click to select a file.
3. Wait for the conversion to complete. Progress will be shown.
4. The converted PDF will be automatically downloaded with '_dark' appended to the filename.

> **Note:**
> - The app works entirely in your browser. Your files are never uploaded.
> - For best results, use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
> - Directly saving to the original folder is not possible due to browser security, but the filename is preserved for easy identification.
